# Writing web applications with Python

This tutorial is a reply to the HN popular article about [Writing Web Applications using only Go](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13247858)
I was courious if is possible to teach with Python to build web applications with just the standard modules.
So far it appears that Go has a more featured standard library, where Python even if it has all the tools,
it gives the dev the work to completly implement a useful-enough application. For the same reason is that 
I consider we have a rich and broad options in Web Frameworks for Python.

So this Tutorial follows the structure and tone from the Go lang original docs, I find it useful and well
suited for teaching.
